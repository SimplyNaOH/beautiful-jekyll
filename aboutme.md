I'm a chemist on the look for a PhD position in solid-state physics, but this blog is about my experiments in programming and electronics. I don't have any formal education on any of those, but that doesn't keep me from playing around ;).

My current interests include functional programming, procedural generation, a little of web development, digital electronics, carpentry, gardening, photography, and much more...

You are welcome to follow my latest developments here. I hope to see you around.
